Hex addressing of output lines:

I2C is kinda tricky to work with. You have to write bytes to different registers. 
The thing that interests us most is the data register, IOLATA or IOLATB.
You've got to issue commands by entering a proper hex address. Translating hex to decimal and binary is helpful here:

0x00 =  0 = 00000000
0x01 =  1 = 00000001
0x02 =  2 = 00000010
0x03 =  3 = 00000011
0x04 =  4 = 00000100
0x05 =  5 = 00000101
0x06 =  6 = 00000110
0x07 =  7 = 00000111
0x08 =  8 = 00001000
0x09 =  9 = 00001001
0x0a = 10 = 00001010
0x0b = 11 = 00001011
0x0c = 12 = 00001100
0x0d = 13 = 00001101
0x0e = 14 = 00001110
0x0f = 15 = 00001111
0x10 = 16 = 00010000
0x11 = 17 = 00010001
0x12 = 18 = 00010010
0x13 = 19 = 00010011
0x14 = 20 = 00010100
0x15 = 21 = 00010101
0x16 = 22 = 00010110
0x17 = 23 = 00010111
0x18 = 24 = 00011000
0x19 = 25 = 00011001
0x1a = 26 = 00011010
0x1b = 27 = 00011011
0x1c = 28 = 00011100
0x1d = 29 = 00011101
0x1e = 30 = 00011110
0x1f = 31 = 00011111
0x20 = 32 = 00100000
0x21 = 33 = 00100001

etc.

(0xdeadbeef means 3735928559 and 11011110101011011011111011101111 respectively :))
