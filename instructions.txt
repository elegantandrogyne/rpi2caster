Enter:
./rpi2caster.py [c, i]* [-dsh]** [RIBBON_FILE]***

* c = cast, i = inventory management
** -d = debug mode, -s = casting simulation (no caster required), -h = help
*** ribbon file path for casting, relative or absolute, case-sensitive

example:
./rpi2caster.py c -s /home/monotype/ribbons/rib1.txt 	(simulate casting a file)
./rpi2caster.py c	 ../ribbons/rib1.txt (cast with a real caster)
./rpi2caster.py c 	(cast with a real caster but choose file from menu)
./rpi2caster.py i 	(inventory management)

HINT: Use shell auto-completion (e.g. "./ca[TAB]").

Have a nice day!
