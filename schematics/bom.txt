Bill of materials
=================

We need certain electronic and mechanical components for the device:
1. A prototyping PCB or breadboard
2. MCP23017 - 2
3. ULN2803 - 4
4. 1k resistors - 1
5. 2k2 resistors - 2, optional
6. 3k3 resistors - 6, optional, can be reduced to one
7. triple DIP switches - 2, optional, can be replaced with jumpers
8. LEDs - 32. I used four arrays of 10 LEDs in a DIP20 package. These will be needed only if we want to 
indicate which row and column is currently worked on.
9. Raspberry Pi mod. B
10. SD card, 2GB or more
11. A power supply which supplies +5V for Raspberry Pi and the interface, and +12 or +24V for solenoid valves.
I used a PSU salvaged from a fax machine. It's a SMPS (switching mode power supply) with 5V and 24V outputs. How convenient.
12. LED, superbright - 1
13. Photodiode, phototransistor or LDR - 1
14. A plexiglass disc - 1. 

We'll paint one section of it, attach it to the Monotype's drive shaft and use it (together with 13. and 14.) as a machine cycle sensor.

15. Solenoid valves - 31. This is the most expensive part of our interface.

Drive voltage: 12V DC or 24V DC 
Air flow: NO (normally open) or three way (unactuated: output is cponnected to exhaust port, actuated: output is connected to air supply)
Min. pressure differential: 0bar - since the Monotype uses 15psi a.k.a. 1bar, any valve which needs more won't be opened and the interface won't work! 
 
The most convenient solution is to use second-hand valve islands salvaged from industrial equipment. If you want new valves, 
you can use valve islands from MATRIX (Italy), part No BX758.8E1C324. They cost somewhere around 150 Euro. You need four such blocks.
One valve will be redundant.

16. A pneumatic interface to connect to the caster.

There are at least three ways to do this:
a) A special block which attaches on the Monotype paper tower and allows to connect air tubes to each of the 31 holes in the tower.
This needs to be very precisely made; I'd suggest CNC milling or 3D printing. The holes are 1...2mm in diameter and approx. 3mm apart. 
The connection must be airtight. A good option for those who want to keep the caster intact.
b) A custom-made connection block matching the Monotype paper tower connection. You need to attach it instead of the tower.
c) The original Monotype paper tower base plate. You can salvage it from the spare paper tower by cutting the 31 air tubes off.
Probably the simplest and most elegant option, but you need to sacrifice one paper tower... if you've got a lot of spares, go ahead.

17. Compressed air tubing, 30...50 meters or so, depends on the distance from the caster to the interface. 
The I.D. depends on the valves used; the best will probably be 4mm.
18. An enclosure. Whatever floats your boat. I've salvaged one from an Iris printer power supply, but you can use anything, 
19" rack enclosures might be a good choice.
