# Define the casters you'll be using your interface with.
# If you have a keyboard's paper tower, define it here too.
#
# A caster is defined by a sub-section in the "Casters" section.
# The subsection is named with the caster's defined name.
#
# In the caster subsection, you specify parameters:
#
#   interface_id [0, 1, 2, 3] - ID of an interface to use with this caster,
#
#   diecase_system [norm15, norm17, hmn, kmn, shift] - diecase format
#                  and how to access row 16 if applicable:
#                  norm15    - 15x15 matrix cases ONLY (oldest)
#                  norm17    - 15x17 NI,NL columns (newer)
#                  hmn       - 16x17 H-M-N (rare)
#                  kmn       - 16x17 K-M-N (rare)
#                  shift     - 16x17 unit shift (post-60s)
#
#   unit_adding [off, on, false, true, no, yes] - whether the machine has an unit-adding attachement
#
#   justification [norm, alt] - justification mode on a caster:
#                 norm        - 0005 fine, 0075 coarse
#                 alt         - NJ fine (replaces 0005), NK coarse (replaces 0075)
#
# If you're using the unit adding attachment, justification will be alternate! 
#
# If the subsection has no entries beside interface_id,
# then it's not usable as a caster, but can be used
# for a keyboard's paper tower.

# Interfaces:
#
# Define one or more interfaces connected to your
# Raspberry Pi. An interface MUST have following parameters:
#   active [true or false]   - whether the interface can be used,
#   stop_gpio [int]          - Broadcom number for emergency stop button GPIO,
#   sensor_gpio [int]        - Broadcom number for sensor GPIO,
#   mcp0_address [hexstring] - 1st MCP23017 I2C address,
#   mcp1_address [hexstring] - 2nd MCP23017 I2C address,
#   pin_base [int]           - pin base for numbering GPIOs on MCP23017 chips,
#   signals_arrangement [str]- order of Monotype signals assigned to outputs
#                              (must be registered under SignalsArrangements)
#
# If no interface is defined, the program will use hardcoded defaults.
# Interface 0 is the default one.

# It's possible to use up to four interfaces (i.e. 2xMCP23017, 4xULN2803)
# for a single Raspberry. It can be used for operating multiple casters,
# or a caster and a keyboard's paper tower, simultaneously (without
# detaching a valve block from the paper tower and moving it elsewhere).
#
# These interfaces should be identified by numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3.
#
# Each of the MCP23017 chips has to have unique I2C addresses. They are
# set by pulling the A0, A1, A2 pins up (to 3.3V) or down (to GND).
# There are 2^3 = 8 possible addresses, and an interface uses two chips,
# so you can use up to four interfaces.
#
# It's best to order the MCP23017 chips' addresses ascending, i.e.
#
# interface_id   mcp0 pin        mcp1 pin        mcp0         mcp1
#                A2,A1,A0        A2,A1,A0        address      address
# 0              000             001             0x20         0x21
# 1              010             011             0x22         0x23
# 2              100             101             0x24         0x25
# 3              110             111             0x26         0x27
#
# where 0 means the pin is pulled down, and 1 means pin pulled up.
#
# As for pin_base parameter, it's the wiringPi's way of identifying GPIOs
# on MCP23017 extenders. WiringPi is an abstraction layer which allows
# you to control (read/write) pins on MCP23017 just like you do it on
# typical Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Thus you don't have to send bytes
# to registers.
# The initial 64 GPIO numbers are reserved for Broadcom SoC,
# so the lowest pin base you can use is 65.
# Each interface (2xMCP23017) uses 32 pins.
#
# If you are using multiple interfaces per Raspberry, you SHOULD
# assign the following pin bases to each interface:
#
# interface_id       pin_base
#      0                65
#      1                98                 (pin_base0 + 32)
#      2               131                 (pin_base1 + 32)
#      3               164                 (pin_base2 + 32)
